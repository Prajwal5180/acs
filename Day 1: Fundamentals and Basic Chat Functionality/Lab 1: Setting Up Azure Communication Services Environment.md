## Lab: Provisioning Azure Communication Services (ACS) Resources

### Objective:
Learn how to provision Azure Communication Services resources using the Azure portal and Azure CLI.

### Prerequisites:
- An active Azure subscription
- Basic knowledge of Azure portal and Azure CLI

### Lab Steps:

#### Step 1: Create a Resource Group
1. **Navigate to the Azure portal** and sign in with your Azure account.
2. **Create a new resource group**:
   - Go to **Resource groups** > **Create**.
   - Fill in the required details (name, region) and click **Review + create**.
   - Click **Create**.

#### Step 2: Create an Azure Communication Services Resource
1. **Navigate to the Azure portal** and go to **Create a resource**.
2. **Search for "Communication Services"** and select it.
3. **Fill in the required details**:
   - Select the subscription and resource group created earlier.
   - Provide a name for the Communication Services resource.
   - Choose the region where you want to deploy the resource.
4. **Click "Review + create"** and then **Create**.

#### Step 3: Access Connection Strings and Service Endpoints
1. **Navigate to the Communication Services resource** you created.
2. **Go to "Keys"** in the left-hand menu.
3. **Copy the connection strings and service endpoints**:
   - You will use these values to authenticate and connect to the Communication Services resource.

#### Step 4: Provision Resources Using Azure CLI
1. **Open Azure CLI** and sign in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
2. **Create a Communication Services resource** using the following command:
   ```bash
   az communication create --name <resource-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --location <region>
   ```
3. **Retrieve connection strings** using Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az communication list-keys --name <resource-name> --resource-group <resource-group>
   ```

#### Step 5: Verify Provisioning
1. **Develop a sample application** to test the provisioning:
   - Use the Azure Communication Services SDK to connect to the provisioned resource.
   - Ensure the application can authenticate and access the Communication Services resource using the connection strings.
2. **Run the application** and verify that the resource is correctly provisioned.

### Conclusion:
By completing this lab, you should be able to provision Azure Communication Services resources using both the Azure portal and Azure CLI effectively.
